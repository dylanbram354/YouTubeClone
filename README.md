# Overview

As the title suggests, this web application (created as a partner-project for devCodeCamp) utilizes various YouTube APIs to create a "clone" of the YouTube UI. Users can search for YouTube videos, watch videos, and view lists of related videos. They can also view and post comments, though these are NOT the actual YouTube comments. Instead, comments are stored on a separate local database that interacts with a Django REST API backend that my partner and I created.

### Technologies
- Javascript + React.js
- Python + Django REST Framework
